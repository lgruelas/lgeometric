# LGeometric

![C++ master race](assets/gcc.png?raw=true "gcc")

C++ Header only library with usefull methods for statistics, computational geometry, machine learning, algorithms and stuff like that, is intended to be for my own use but not limited to that, if there is something usefull to you please feel free to use it.

Examples of usage can be found in [CPP-Snippets](https://github.com/lgruelas/Cpp-snippets) repo.
